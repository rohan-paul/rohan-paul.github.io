@Akbar — In each cohort of the bootcamp there are good mix of people who have a solid CS background, and some others who are coming from a completely different background with zero programming knowledge. However, in my personal experience, its hugely beneficial if you come with some basic javascript knowledge, like you should be able to write simple JS functions, and be familiar with its syntax, and common ES-6 methods. And also some basic knowledge of HTML. Because, within the first 45/60 days in the bootcamp you will be starting with Express and start building basic apps and also solve plethora of JS problems.
