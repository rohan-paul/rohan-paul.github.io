## Bootcamp: Day 1

Monday 26th March — The Hacking School's Marach-2018-B cohort. The day some ten of us embark on a great journey for the next 13 intensive weeks with the dream and hope of becoming pro-web-application developers in MEAN and MERN stack.

Session kick started at 11am! We got our brand new Dell Inspiron laptops out and introduced us. [Meraj Faheem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/merajf/), the CEO and founder of [The Hacking School](http://thehackingschool.com/) arrived to greet us, and inspire everyone for our journeys into software development. Telling the class, how nothing can match the joy, when you create an application or product, and some other people uses it to solve some of their problems. And advised us again and again to just build, build and build! at this stage, and not to unnecessary focus of optimization of the codes which can be picked up on the way as we master the skills after a while.


After an hour for lunch when few of us made good use of Hyderabadi Dum Biryani, we got back to desks with a full on speed on HTTP architechture, requests-response cycle, classification of IP addresses, concepts of Port Numbers and how this knowledge will make sense of whats happening when we structure an MEAN / MERN stack app and set up an node server.
