**Solving the Three-Sum Problem with JavaScript**

A great and classic challenge, **[3-Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)** and  extremely popular for interviews, I faced in Leetcode, and can be solved with variying level of efficiency and beauty.

**Problem Statement - Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets. Example: Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]**

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]


**Solution-1-My Brute Force Solution**

The requirement is to find all unique triplets in the array. That is, the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets. This means in the resultant array, no number would be repeated. So, I wil achieve this with the following technique.

A> The most simple way to remove duplicates is to stop considering the same value for the same index more than once. Donâ€™t let i, j or k refer to the same value in the array twice. Let x refer to some value in the array. Once we have set i=x and found all y, z such that x+y+z=0, we never have to consider setting i=x again.

B> First sort the array. So if there are multiple numbers, like two 5's they will come sequentially. So, whilte iterating for say ``i``, I will hit the two sequential ``5's`` in my two sequential iteration. So I can skip over the second iteration, usingn ``continue``.

C> So after sorting the array, will check for each iteration that the current element that I am taking is not === previous element. That is if ``nums[i] === nums[i-1]) continue``

D> An example below..

My First native brute force solution of traversing the array 3 times checking for all combinations of 3 numbers if their sum produces zero. Although the code produced the correct result in my local machine, but it took so long in Leetcode's exhaustive test-cases, that it gave me "TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED" error there in Leetcode.

Note, the 2nd and 3rd for loops (indexed by j and k) stars from i+1 and j+1 respectively, skipping over indices that are already used, instead of 0. This is so, because, suppose we found a triplet, a0,a1,a2 with j pointing to a0 and i pointing to a1 with ``j < i``. Then, we would have found the same triplet with i pointing to a0 and j pointing to a1 on a previous iteration giving us a duplicate output.


**Complexity Analysis**

Time complexity : O(n^3)

Because each of these nested loops executes n times, the total time complexity is **O(n^3)**, where n is a size of an array.

Space complexity : **O(n^2)**. If we assume that resultant array is not considered as additional space we need **O(n^2)** space for storing triplets in a set.


**Solution-3- Much Faster ``"2-pointer-solution"`` in ``O(n^2)`` Time**

A> As a first step, just like the previous solution, since we're dealing with an array of numbers it makes great sense to sort things before diving into algorithm mechanics. 

B> Instead of 3 nested for loops, here I will use 1 for-loop and one while-loop. I will invoke the for-loop ``for (let indexA = 0; indexA < nums.length - 2; indexA++)`` and the first statement in my for-loop will allow the first iteration to run and skip over any subsequent iterations that would lead to the same calulation. So, if my array becomes [1,1,1,3,3] and I am looking at the 0 element 1 - I no more iterate any further.

B> Now with each iteration of the first for loop, keeping ``a's`` value constant, I am looping the values of the next 2 variables ``b`` and ``c`` to check if ``(a + b + c = 0)``. ``b`` starting from indexA + 1 and increasing and ``c`` starting from the end of the array ``nums.length - 1`` and decreasing.

Since the number array is sorted, the plan is to pull b and c closer together - checking each time for the sum array values to equal 0.

C> If I see that the result (sum of Triplets i.e a + b + c) is more than zero, I can decrement from right-most elements to reach zero.
And if the result is less than zero, I increment the b (middle element in the triplet) elements value to react zero.

D> After all values of ``b`` and ``c`` are exhausted, I go back to the next iteration of the for loop for the next value of ``a``.

 Given ``a`` has the lowest value after sorting the array, and with each value of ``a``, I have already iterated through checking for all values of ``b`` and ``c``  to check if sum is zero - as soon as ``a`` becomes > 0 I can return from the function. Because it means I have reached a point where all the subsequent values of the array will be higher than zero. **So no point in iterating further when ``a > 0``**.

E> And ``a`` will only take value upto ``(nums.length - 3)`` as the last 2 values will be taken by the subsequent 2 variables ``b`` and ``c``
