**Quick Sort**

If youâ€™re interviewing for a developer position, one of the more intimidating questions that can be asked is explaining how the Quicksort algorithm works. 

The algorithm for Quicksort is:

1. Pick a pivot element that divides the list into two sublists.

2. Reorder the list so that all elements less than the pivot element are placed before the pivot and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 on both the list with smaller elements and the list of larger elements.

Below is a basic implementation
